This is our repository for our Summer 2024 Erdos Deep Learning Project. The aim of the project is to predict the likelihood of common pathogenic bacteria being resistant to a given antimicrobial small molecule drug by examining the possible correlation between the DNA sequence that codes for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and the SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) data for each antibiotic that represents its structure with an essentially extended Latin alphabet.
